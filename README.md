# Database-updater

This is the code i wrote to give API calls to two APIs. First one is a free tier API i got from "WeatherAPI-rapidAPI" and the second one i built on my own using a machine learning algorithm to return weather condition predictions.


This Code then takes the response from the APIs, formats the data and append it to my cloud database on Heroku
